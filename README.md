# Simple Low Cost Hearing Aid

## 📌 Project Overview
This project presents the design and implementation of a **Simple Low-Cost Hearing Aid** aimed at providing an affordable hearing assistance solution for individuals with mild hearing impairment. The system amplifies weak audio signals using basic electronic components while maintaining low power consumption and simplicity.

## 🎯 Objectives
- To design a cost-effective hearing aid using discrete components
- To amplify low-level sound signals clearly
- To provide adjustable volume control for user comfort
- To ensure portability and low power consumption

## ⚙️ Working Principle
The hearing aid captures sound through a condenser microphone, converts it into an electrical signal, and amplifies it using a multi-stage transistor amplifier circuit. The amplified signal is then delivered to an earphone, allowing the user to hear sounds more clearly.

## 🧠 Circuit Description
The circuit uses a combination of **BC548, BC107, and SK100 transistors** arranged in multiple amplification stages. Capacitors are used for signal coupling and noise reduction, while a **4.7kΩ potentiometer** allows volume control. The entire system operates on a **3V DC power supply**, making it energy-efficient and portable.

## 🧩 Key Components
- Condenser Microphone
- BC548 Transistor
- BC107 Transistors
- SK100 Transistor
- Resistors and Capacitors
- 4.7kΩ Potentiometer
- Earphones
- 3V Battery Supply

## 🖥️ Applications
- Hearing assistance for individuals with mild hearing loss
- Low-cost healthcare electronics
- Educational electronics projects
- Portable audio amplification systems

## 📊 Results
The hearing aid successfully amplified weak audio signals with clear output at low and medium volumes. Power consumption was low (approximately 2–5 mA), ensuring longer battery life. Minor distortion at high volume levels was observed and can be improved in future versions.
